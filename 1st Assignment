----Mini Port Scanner----

## 1. Introduction

A **port scanner** is a network tool used to identify open ports on a target host. 
This project demonstrates a simple **mini port scanner** developed in Python using the `socket` library. 
The tool is designed for **educational purposes** to understand basic network scanning concepts.

## 2. Objective

- To develop a basic Python program to scan open TCP ports on a target system.  
- To gain hands-on experience with socket programming.  
- To understand the fundamentals of network reconnaissance.

## 3. Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 3  
- **Library**: `socket` (standard library)  
- **Operating System**: Cross-platform (Windows/Linux)

## 4. System Requirements

- Python 3.x installed  
- Terminal/Command Prompt access  
- Basic understanding of IP addresses and ports

## 5. Algorithm / Working

1. Input the target host (IP or domain).  
2. Input starting and ending port range.  
3. Use `socket` to attempt a connection on each port.  
4. If the connection succeeds, the port is **open**.  
5. Display results and close the connection.

## 6. Code Implementation

```python
import socket

# Input target and port range
target = input("Enter target host: ")
start_port = int(input("Enter start port: "))
end_port = int(input("Enter end port: "))

print(f"\nScanning {target} from port {start_port} to {end_port}\n")

# Iterate through ports
for port in range(start_port, end_port + 1):
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.settimeout(0.5)
    result = s.connect_ex((target, port))
    if result == 0:
        print(f"Port {port} is OPEN")
    s.close()

print("\nScan complete.")

## 7. Example Execution
**Input:**
Enter target host: 127.0.0.1
Enter start port: 20
Enter end port: 80
**Output:**
Scanning 127.0.0.1 from port 20 to 80
Port 22 is OPEN
Port 80 is OPEN
Scan complete.

## 8. Results

- Successfully scanned a given host.  
- Identified open ports accurately within the specified range.  
- Demonstrated fundamental network scanning capabilities.

## 9. Conclusion

The mini port scanner helps in understanding how **TCP port scanning** works using socket programming. 
It is a foundation for building advanced tools like multi-threaded scanners or security auditing tools.

## 10. Future Enhancements

- Add **multi-threading** to improve speed.  
- Implement **UDP scanning** support.  
- Provide **graphical user interface (GUI)**.  
- Save scan reports to file.
